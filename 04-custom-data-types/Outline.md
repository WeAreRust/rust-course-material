# Outline

- Tuple and struct
    - tuple
        - instantiating and destructing
        - dot notation
        - empty tuple â†’ unit type
    - struct
        - instantiating
            - `Struct { field: value }`
            - `Struct { field }`
            - `Struct { field, ..another }`
        - accessing content: dot notation & destructure
        - tuple struct & unit-like struct
- Method and associated function
    - method syntax, `&self`, `&mut self`, and `self`
    - associated function (over constructor)
    - privacy
        - private by default, and it's `mod` level
        - `pub` and `pub(mod)` syntax
- Enum
    - three kinds of variants (unit, unnamed, and named)
    - method
- Pattern matching
    - match enum variants
    - `match` is exhaustive and `_` placeholder
    - match against number, string, multiple items (via `|`), and range of numbers
    - value binding
        - ignoring parts via `..`
        - `@` binding
        - ownership and borrowing of binding variable
        - legacy usage of `ref` and `ref mut`
    - nested matching
    - match guard
    - `if let` and `while let`
    - other places with pattern matching
        - `let` statement
        - `for` loop
        - function parameter
