# Rust

## Day 5. Generics and Traits

---

## Theory of Traits

--

## Generics
## Trait Bounds
## Common and custom traits
## Traits with Trait Bounds
## Deriving Trait impls

--

## Generic Traits & Associated Types

---

Theory of Traits

## This is a trait

```rust
trait MyTrait {
    fn foo(&self, n: u8);


    fn bar(&self) -> MyStruct;
}
```

--

## And what is it used for?

- You can think of them like interfaces but...

--

# They're not interfaces!

---

Theory of Traits

- A way to guarantee that a __type__ has some __functionality__.

--

- Remember the `impl` block we used to add functionality.

```rust
struct RustCourse;

impl RustCourse {
    // We are adding some functionality to the RustCourse type
    fn is_rusty(&self) -> bool {
        true
    }
}
```

```rust
struct NonRustCourse;

impl NonRustCourse {
    fn is_rusty(&self) -> bool {
        false
    }
}
```

--

## Need some way to guarantee this

---

Theory of Traits

## We can use a Trait

```rust
trait Course {
    fn is_rusty(&self) -> bool;
}
```

--

## And add functionality in a guaranteed way

```rust
impl Course for RustCourse {
    fn is_rusty(&self) -> bool {
        true
    }
}

impl Course for NonRustCourse {
    fn is_rusty(&self) -> bool {
        false
    }
}
```

---

Theory of Traits

## Looks a lot like an interface right?

# They're not interfaces!

---

Theory of Traits

## Dispatching function calls

### __Traits__ are __statically__ dispatched

Process called monomorphization

### __Interfaces__ are __dynamically__ dispatched

VTables

--

## Also don't do OOP in Rust

---

Theory of Traits

## Static dispatched is...

--

### Faster & more efficient

No runtime overhead since function calls are resolved at compile time rather
than at runtime.

### And also less flexible

Must know types at compile time.

But Rust has a way to do dynamic dispatch as well, with __Trait Objects__

--

... but that's outside the scope of this talk -

---

Theory of Traits

## What does all this give us?

---

Theory of Traits

## Futures

- Like promises
- Allow asyncronous execution
- No overhead, no required runtime, just traits

--

```rust
pub trait Future {
    type Output;

    fn poll(&mut Self, cx: &mut Context) -> Poll<Self::Output>;
}
```

--

Use them anywhere and anywhere (async/await not yet stable)

---

Theory of Traits

## Iterators

- Personally, a little surprising how powerful they are
- Sometimes more efficient than `for` loops
- Like `Future`, this is a ZCA.

--

[iterators docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html)

--

Will work on the most restricted hardware to the most powerful supercomputer.

---

Theory of Traits

Just before we jump into code.

--

## Rayon (crate)

```rust
use rayon::prelude::*;
fn sum_of_squares(input: &[i32]) -> i32 {
  input.par_iter() // <-- just change that!
       .map(|&i| i * i)
       .sum()
}
```
