## Workshop

Implement some basic unix utilities. Don't worry about supporting any flags or arguments other than the ones listed. You can see my attempts in the `ls`, `cat` and `grep` directories.

1. `ls` -- list the files and nested directories in the current directory
2. `cat [*files]` -- concatenate all files passed as arguments
3. `grep [path] [pattern]` -- do a naive substring search inside `path` for the string `pattern`
