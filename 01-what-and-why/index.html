# Rust

## Day 1

---
# Why Rust?

???

Before we get into the details, I want to sell you on Rust and why it's so important for the future of software.

---

# Mutability

--

## *Mut*able == Can mutate

--

#### /ˈmjuːtəb(ə)l/
changeable, variable, varying, fluctuating, shifting, inconsistent, **unpredictable**, inconstant, **uncertain**, fluid, erratic, irregular, uneven, unsettled, unstable, unsteady

---

# How do we deal with mutability?

--

### Object Oriented Programming
   > Encapsulate mutable state and hide it behind methods. Use `private` so it can't be accessed.

--

### Functional Programming
   > Mutation is bad! Don't mutate anything! Make a copy if you need to change something.

--

### Rust
   > Mutation is inevitable, so we'll add some simple compiler rules to make it safe.

---

# Three simple rules of data in Rust

--

## - There can only be *one* owner (at a time)

--

## and either:

--

### - *Many* read-only borrows; OR

--

### - *One* mutable borrow

---

# The ownership system

???

A unique feature of Rust is the ownership system.

---

# Low level languages force you to think about memory

???

Low level languages like C and C++ force you to think about memory allocation.
Generally you need to be aware of when memory is allocated, when values are copied, when they're shared, and
when they're are cleaned up.

On the other hand, high level languages abstract that away from you. Sometimes they copy something by value,
sometimes by reference, and sometimes you get control over that. But the allocation and deallocation happens
transparently. The garbage collector spends time going around cleaning up old unused values.

---

# You can't escape memory

???

Memory managed languages (Java, JavaScript etc) have given us the impression that we shouldn't have to think about memory.

But your program still uses memory. Whether it runs in a browser or the cloud, you are constrained by memory.

I think many people in the room will have seen at least one case where you've had to think about your memory allocations
because they got out of control, the garbage collector had to do too much work, and it was slowing the application down.

Actually, we should be **thinking about memory more**. We should have more control over it and be more aware of how our programs consume it.

---

```typescript
const user = { name: 'Ted', age: 27 };
const user2 = { ...user, name: 'Lucy' };
```

```rust
let user = User { name: "Ted"; age: 27 };
let user2 = user.clone();
user2
```

---

## ...but managing memory is scary

???

The problem has traditionally been that managing memory ourselves is dangerous.

Accidentally accessing a portion of memory after our variable has been cleared from the region can introduce security bugs and crashes. That's called a "Use after free" bug, and it's
exactly what caused the major Chrome security flaw in March.

Mutating the same piece of memory in two threads at the same time is risky. That's a race condition. This is a risk even in high level languages
that supposedly manage memory for you.

---

# Rust makes it safe to manage memory

???

The Rust compiler is like having the bumpers up. It will guide you and if you try to do something dangerous with memory, it won't let you compile.

You can think of the strict compiler like a teacher, it will help you better understand how memory is managed in your app, and make sure you don't mess up.

---

# It will be difficult in the beginning

???

In the beginning, you will struggle. You'll be frustrated that the compiler won't let you build anything.

But just have faith that it's trying to be helpful, and in time you'll start thinking the Rust way. It's a
different way of thinking about programs, but if you stick with it, it'll change the way you write code in
other languages too.

---

# If C is like playing with knives and C++ is like juggling chainsaws then Rust is like parkour wearing protective gear while suspended from strings. It may look ridiculous at times, but you can do all sorts of awesome moves that would be damn scary or outright impossible without it.

`u/llogiq` on `r/rust`

---

# An incredibly powerful type system

???

Taking inspiration from languages like **OCaml and Haskell**

Rust supports some very powerful patterns for programming with types, and validating your business logic at compile time.

And yes, it supports generics.

---

.imgFull[![Stack Overflow Survey](./most-loved-lang.png)]

???

Also, developers love it.

Rust has been the top of the "Most Loved" languages in the Stack Overflow developer survey for **4 years in a row**.

---

???

Rust provides:
 - The control of a low level language + the safety of a high level language
 - The safety of immutable data with mutability
