# What is Rust?

## A programming language with

--

## ... no runtime

--

## ... no garbage collector

--

## ... that compiles to native code

--

## ... and it's really fast

# Why Rust?

---

# Why Rust?

## The community 💛

--

### The community is incredibly welcoming and helpful

--
### Code of conduct & moderation team

--
### Meetups everywhere

--

 > Something I think Rust gets right, the community, the book, even the compiler, is that it does believe in you, but it also doesn't expect you to just "get it" overnight.
 > **There is a tone to the literature, to the compiler messages, to the IRC channel, which is this: "we understand." **

# Why Rust?

## Maintenance

### Rust is built with long term maintainability in mind

--

### Powerful type system


--

### Built-in unit & integration testing. No test framework churn.

--

### Built-in documentation generation (like Javadoc, JSDoc etc)

--

### Doctests 🥰

---

# Why Rust?

## Memory safety is hard

# Why Rust?

## Memory safety is hard

### C/C++: _Trust me, I'm an engineer_

--

### Rust: _Help me, I am a mere human_

--

### The ownership system

--

### Safe mutability

--

### Explicit lifetimes

---

# If C is like playing with knives and C++ is like juggling chainsaws then Rust is like parkour wearing protective gear while suspended from strings. It may look ridiculous at times, but you can do all sorts of awesome moves that would be damn scary or outright impossible without it.

---

# Why Rust?

## WebAssembly (wasm)

--

### Native-like instruction set that can run anywhere (including browsers)

--

### It's kind of a big deal

--

(Figma renders their canvas with it)

--

### Rust is arguably the best positioned language to take advantage of wasm

--

### Output can be lightweight, fast, and efficient

--

### But Rust still provides enough abstractions to be useful

---

# Why Rust?

## Rust breaks down some of the barriers between systems programming and "high-level" programming

---

# When to use Rust?

--

### For RAM/CPU bound applications

--

### When resource management is important (RAM, sockets, files, processes, even Docker containers)

--

### For cross-platform binaries with no dependencies

--

### Security conscious tools

--

### CLI tools

--

### As a tool for learning low level computing

---

# Why not Rust?

--

### Prototyping (the compiler can be slow)

--

### When you need to hire a lot of people (for now)

--

### UI based apps (for now)

--

### Async applications (for now. `async/await` are coming soon. OS thread support is already excellent)

--

### You want to implement a doubly linked list from scratch

--

### Many embedded applications (for now, but the future is bright. Chat to Ben T)

---

# Who uses it?

--

### *Figma*: Multiplayer server [(link)](https://www.figma.com/blog/rust-in-production-at-figma/)

--

### *Mozilla*: Rewriting core parts of Firefox in Rust. See the Servo project.

--

### *npm*: Rewrote their CPU bound auth service in Rust (from Node)

--

### *Dropbox*: Parts of their "Magic Pocket" storage system are built in Rust

--

### *Yelp*: Using it for their A/B testing framework

---

# What to expect

--

### There *is* a steep learning curve

--

### Keep an open mind. It can feel like learning to code again.

--

### (Don't try to write OOP code in Rust)

--

### Remember, the type system is there to help you

--

### Eventually, the compiler will start to feel like your code-pair

# A sampling of Rust's features

---

# Pattern matching

--

## Like a `switch`, but far more powerful

--

```rust
match color {
  "red"   => set_color(Rgb { r: 255, g: 0, b: 0 }),
  "green" => set_color(Rgb { r: 0, g: 255, b: 0 }),
  "blue"  => set_color(Rgb { r: 0, g: 0, b: 255 }),
  _ => panic!("Unknown color!")
};
```

--

```rust
let rgb = match color {
  "red"   => Rgb { r: 255, g: 0, b: 0 },
  "green" => Rgb { r: 0, g: 255, b: 0 },
  "blue"  => Rgb { r: 0, g: 0, b: 255 },
  _ => panic!("Unknown color!")
};
set_color(rgb)
```

---

# Pattern matching

```rust
let color = match rgb {
  Rgb { r: 255, g: 0, b: 0 }  => "red",
  Rgb { r: 0, g: 255, b: 0 }  => "green",
  Rgb { r: 0, g: 0, b: 255 }  => "blue",
  _ => panic!("Unknown color!")
};
```

---

# Pattern matching

```rust
let color = match rgb {
  Rgb { r: 255, .. }  => "red",
  Rgb { g: 255, .. }  => "green",
  Rgb { b: 255, .. }  => "blue",
  _ => panic!("Unknown color!")
};
```

---

# Pattern matching

```rust
let color = match rgb {
  Rgb { r: 255, g, b } if g < 100 && b < 100  => "red",
  Rgb { g: 255, r, b } if r < 100 && b < 100  => "green",
  Rgb { b: 255, g, r } if g < 100 && r < 100  => "blue",
  _ => panic!("Unknown color!")
};
```

--

## Includes exhaustive checking

```rust
error[E0004]: non-exhaustive patterns: `_` not covered
  --> src/main.rs:17:23

17 |       let color = match rgb {
   |                         ^^^ pattern `_` not covered
   |
   = help: ensure that all possible cases are being handled, possibly by adding wildcards or more match arms
```

---

# Option type

## Something that may or may not exist

#### (like a type safe `Nullable` or `T | undefined`)

--

### `Option<T>`

```rust
let `definition` = dictionary.get("colorful");
//  ^^^^^^^^^^ This is an Option<String>

match definition {
  Some(def) => println!("The definition of this word is: {}", def),
  None      => println!("Could not find this word"),
};
```

--

```rust
let definition = dictionary
  .get("colorful")
  .unwrap_or("No definition found");

println!("The definition of this word is: {}", definition);
```
---

# Result type

### Rust applications generally don't throw exceptions (known as panics) for errors that are typically expected

--

### `Result<T, Err>`

```rust
let `file_result` = File::open("foo.txt");
//  ^^^^^^^^^^^ This is a Result<File, Err>

match file_result {
  Ok(file)   => /* Do something with the file  */,
  Err(error) => /* Do something with the error */,
};
```

---

# Compile-time Macros

## Run Rust code at compile time

--

### Write Rust that writes Rust

--

### Very powerful, but don't overuse

--

### `serde`

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
    city: String,
}
```
---

# Mutability

--

## *Mut*able == Can mutate

--

#### /ˈmjuːtəb(ə)l/
changeable, variable, varying, fluctuating, shifting, inconsistent, **unpredictable**, inconstant, **uncertain**, fluid, erratic, irregular, uneven, unsettled, unstable, unsteady

---

# How do we deal with mutability?

--

### C
   > Do whatever you want.

--

### Object Oriented Programming
   > Encapsulate mutable state and hide it behind methods. Use `private` so it can't be accessed.

--

### Functional Programming
   > Mutation is bad! Don't mutate anything! Make a copy if you need to change something.

--

### Rust
   > In real world applications, mutation is inevitable, so we'll add some compiler rules to make it safe.

---

# Three rules of data in Rust

--

## - There can only be *one* owner (at a time)

--

## and either:

--

### - *Many* read-only borrows; OR

--

### - *One* mutable borrow

---

# The ownership system

---

# Lower level languages force you to think about memory

--

## You can't escape memory, even in higher level languages

--

## but managing memory can be dangerous and feels error-prone

--

## Rust makes it safer to do so. Rust has your back.

---

# Some terminology

## "Unsafe"

Any kind of manual memory allocation/deallocation, raw pointer arithmetic, or sharing memory directly is considered `unsafe`.
Unsafe code will not compile, unless you wrap it in a block marked `unsafe`. Rust provides enough abstractions that you should almost
never need to reach for the `unsafe` keyword, but it's there if you need it.

--

## "Zero-cost abstractions"

> What you don’t use, you don’t pay for. And further: What you do use, you couldn’t hand code any better.
>
> _~ Bjarne Stroustrup_, creator of C++

---

# Some terminology

## Cargo

Cargo is Rust's build tool, test runner, doc generator, dependency manager, and project scaffolder all in one.

--

## Crate

A crate is a Rust package, similar to a node module. Public crates are listed on the crates.io registry.

--

## Rustup

`rustup` is the tool used for managing the Rust compiler versions and cargo. You can use `rustup` to keep your compiler
up to date, install specific versions, switch between the stable and nightly version of the compiler, or install new
target architectures/operating systems to compile to.

---

# Some terminology

## "The Book"

The Rust book is a freely available online book from some core members of the community. It's an extremely detailed, excellent resource for learning the language. Simply google "The Rust Book".
